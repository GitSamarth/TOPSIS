This project is a simple TOPSIS-based decision support tool that allows users to upload a dataset, specify criteria weights and impacts, and compute rankings using the TOPSIS method.

The application focuses on user input and processing, while the results are generated and saved as an output file.

📌 Features
CSV file upload support
Input of criteria weights (comma-separated)
Input of criteria impacts (+ for benefit, - for cost)
Backend computation using the TOPSIS algorithm
Result generation in CSV format
⚙️ Working Principle
User uploads the CSV file
User enters weights and impacts
Data is processed using the TOPSIS method
Scores and ranks are calculated internally
Output is generated as a result file
